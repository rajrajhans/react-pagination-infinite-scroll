## Infinite Scroll in React

[Link to associated blog post](https://rajrajhans.com/2021/04/infinite-scroll-in-react/)

When you have to to present large amount of data records, you have two options. You can either use pagination, which means that you'll display certain number of records on a screen and then the user has to click on a button to load the next set of data.

This is a demo React app that basically calls the Unsplash API to get random images, 10 at a time, and displays them.

The `pagination` branch of this repo contains the implementation for this using pagination.

The `master` branch contains the implementation for the same using infinite scroll.
